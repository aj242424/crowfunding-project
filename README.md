# crowfunding-project
A crowdfunding project which makes use of voting to make sure whom the funds should be transferred to

In crowdfunding a company collects funds from contributors for various purposes like charity, business. But the issue with traditional crowdfunding is that it is not easy to ensure that the Company doesnot run away with the collected money instead of contributing to its intended purpose. A smart contract would help to handle this concern. The smart contract can set a Manager Account. The manager represents companys interests and sets targets for receiving funding for various purposes (eg Business,environment,charity etc.
The Manager sets the parameters such as target fund amount, deadline to receive amount,minimum contribution to be given by the contributors.
The smart contract is designed by the company and the  contributors transfer their funds to the smart contract. For Manager to access money from Smart Contract, he will
need to get permission from contributors.
The smart contract acts as a mediator between manager and contributor.If the deadline for raising the desired amount is not met the contributors can take back
their funds from the smart contract.
